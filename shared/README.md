# Shared Resources

This folder is for shared resources that need to be accessed by both frontend and backend.

## Potential Uses

- **API Types/Schemas**: If using TypeScript on frontend, you could define shared types here
- **Constants**: Shared configuration values
- **Documentation**: API documentation, diagrams, etc.

## Current Structure

```
shared/
├── README.md      # This file
└── (add your shared files here)
```

## Notes

- Keep this folder minimal
- Most code should live in the respective module folders
- Use this only for truly shared resources that don't fit elsewhere
