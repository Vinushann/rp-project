# Comprehensive Action Plan for January 2026

## Demand Outlook
- **Total Projected Sales**: 3,000 units for January 2026.
- **Busiest Days**: Focus on January 15, 20, and 28 for staffing and inventory preparations.
- **Sales Accuracy**: Maintain a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 150 and a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 5.0 to ensure reliable forecasting.

## Promotions
- **Discount Focus**:
  - **Pastries**: Offer a "Buy One Get One Free" promotion on select pastries to increase foot traffic and encourage additional purchases.
  - **Sandwiches**: Implement a combo deal (sandwich + drink) at a discounted price to boost sales of both items.
  - **Seasonal Drinks**: Highlight seasonal drinks (e.g., Mocha and Cold Brew) with a 10% discount to attract customers looking for winter-themed beverages.
- **Marketing Campaign**: Utilize social media and in-store signage to promote these discounts, especially leading up to the busiest days.

## Staffing
- **Increased Staffing on Busiest Days**: Schedule additional staff on January 15, 20, and 28 to handle the expected increase in customer volume.
- **Training**: Ensure all staff are trained on the new promotions and product offerings to enhance customer service and sales effectiveness.

## Inventory
- **Top Items**: Ensure adequate stock of top-selling items (Espresso, Cappuccino, Latte, Mocha, Cold Brew) to meet demand.
- **Falling Items**: Monitor inventory levels of falling items (Iced Tea, Chai Latte, Fruit Smoothie) and consider reducing stock to minimize waste.
- **Seasonal Items**: Prepare for increased demand for seasonal drinks by ordering extra supplies in advance.

## Risks
- **Supply Chain Disruptions**: Monitor suppliers closely to avoid stockouts, especially for top items and seasonal drinks.
- **Customer Preferences**: Be prepared to adjust promotions based on customer feedback and sales data throughout the month.
- **Economic Factors**: Stay informed about local economic conditions that may affect consumer spending and adjust strategies accordingly.
